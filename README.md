# OpenGL 

  Want to learn OpenGL? Follow this tutorial: [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/OpenGL)
 
  The problem is that is built under Windows and Visual Studio.
  This repo is my place to store some examples, APIs and libraries I'am using
  to learn OpenGL under **Linux.**

## Dependencies
  OpenGL Libraries: Mesa, NVidia or AMD specific libraries to deal with OpenGL
rendering in your machine (OS/Vendor specific)

  GLUT/FREEGLUT/GLFW: Wrapper over OpenGL libraries to deal with Windows, User Input
and OpenGL contexts in your machine (OS specific). In this project we use FreeGLUT,
which is based on GLUT library.

  Linux: This project runs over most Linux distributions with hardware that
supports OpenGL (e.g. simple Intel processors)
